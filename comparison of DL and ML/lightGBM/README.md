# US-Car-Severity-predition_New-York-City
Identifying the circumstances under what features affect accident severity and which areas have high accident rates can help insurance companies predict premium and budget of expenditure. To understand factors influencing the severity of US car accidents, including location and weather-related conditions, several classification models were developed. This project focus on the prediction of US car accident severity using the Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and two popular tree-based ensemble methods, XGBoost and LightGBM. In the process, we first try PCA and then perform Grid-search and Cross-validation to tune the parameters. In order to solve the spatial heterogeneity and imbalanced data problems, we conduct the analysis of the whole United States and New York City with the resampling method. We finally make some comparations about methods and models we used to find a better way to predict the US car severity.
